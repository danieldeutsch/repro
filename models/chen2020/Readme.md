## Available Models
This implementation contains a wrapper around the LERC model trained on all of the constituent datasets plus their evaluation script.

- [LERC](https://storage.googleapis.com/allennlp-public-models/lerc-2020-11-18.tar.gz)
  - Description: The LERC model trained on all datasets
  - Name: `chen2020-lerc`
  - Usage:
    ```python
    from repro.models.chen2020 import LERC
    model = LERC()
    score = model.predict("context", "question", "reference", "candidate")
    ```
    
- MOCHA Evaluation
  - Description: The MOCHA evaluation script that calculates the Pearson correlation between the ground-truth and predicted scores.
  - Name: `chen2020-eval`
  - Usage:
    ```python
    from repro.models.chen2020 import MOCHAEvaluationMetric
    model = MOCHAEvaluationMetric()
    # `inputs` should have the dataset, source, ground-truth score,
    # and predictions
    inputs = [
        {"dataset": dataset, "source": source, "score": score, "prediction": prediction},
        ...
    ]
    metrics = model.predict_batch(inputs)
    ```
