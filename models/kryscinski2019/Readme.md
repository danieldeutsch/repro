## Available Models
This implementation wraps the FactCC and FactCCX models.
Both models will return a score and a label.
The score is the probability of the returned label (for binary classification) with label 1 meaning "incorrect".

- FactCC:
  - Description: A model to score the factual consistency of text
  - Name: `kryscinski2019-factcc`
  - Usage:
    ```python
    from repro.models.kryscinski2019 import FactCC
    model = FactCC()
    inputs = [
        {"candidate": "The candidate text", "sources": ["The source text"]}
    ]
    macro, micro = model.predict_batch(inputs)
    ```
    `macro` contains the scores averaged over the inputs, whereas `micro` contains the scores for each input.

- FactCCX:
  - Description: A model to score the factual consistency of text
  - Name: `kryscinski2019-factccx`
  - Usage:
    ```python
    from repro.models.kryscinski2019 import FactCCX
    model = FactCCX()
    inputs = [
        {"candidate": "The candidate text", "sources": ["The source text"]}
    ]
    macro, micro = model.predict_batch(inputs)
    ```
    `macro` contains the scores averaged over the inputs, whereas `micro` contains the scores for each input.
    
## Implementation Notes
- We modified the script to run prediction because it did not save the scores of the model, just the overall labels.
The modified script can be found [here](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/repro/blob/master/models/kryscinski2019/src/run_test.py).
