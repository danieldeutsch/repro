Mix together first 5 ingredients and cook over medium heat until thickened; add the butter and stir to melt. Remove from heat. Place apples in pie shell and pour sauce on top of the apples. Blend cream cheese with 1/3 cup sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg and blend well. Stir in coconut and nuts and spread on top of apples. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Let cool completely before serving. Store in refrigerator. This is a very good recipe and is easy to make! :). It's also delicious if you use a 9 inch unbaked pie crust instead of the one you buy from your grocery store. I like this pie better that way. Enjoy!!. I am sure that you can use any type of apple, such as gala or granny smith apples. The apples can be either grated or sliced. You might need more cream cheese and sugar,",

Combine cornstarch, 1/2 C sugar and cream in saucepan; stir over low heat until mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and add lemon juice, 2 Tbsp butter and sliced apples; mix well. Pour into pie shell. Cream Cheese Filling: Blend softened cream cheese with remaining 1/3 C sugar and egg; beat thoroughly. Add coconut and nuts; blend thoroughly. Spread on top of apple filling; bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm with whipped topping. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator. Yields 6 servings. NOTE: You may substitute fresh apple slices (about 4 medium) for the apples used in this recipe. It is not necessary to peel, core, slice, and boil. The apples will still be crisp and sweet. I would think a little cinnamon can be added to the apples if desired. Also"
